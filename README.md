The application presents a game in which the user must knock down 5 black rectangles using a colorful blue ball that bounces off walls and rectangles. The player can also control a single red rectangle using the left and right arrows on the keyboard or screen. The game ends when the ball touches the bottom wall, and the player loses, or when all 5 rectangles are knocked down, which means the user wins.
